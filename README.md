# rbgb

A simple Game Boy emulator written in Rust.

## Features

- CPU emulation (Sharp LR35902)
- Memory management
- Basic graphics rendering
- ROM loading

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Hyphen325/rbgb.git

    ```

2. Build the project:

    ```

3. Run the emulator with a ROM:
